# Use good variable names

My freshman year of college I was helping one of my dorm mates with a homework assignment.
His code was a mess, but I still remember asking him:

Me: Why is this variable named windex?
Him: Because it's the index of winning.

I wanted to punch him in the face (and he was a friend).

- Good names aren't cute or cool.
- Good names don't require you to ask, "what does X stand for?".

Coworker would mispell words, this is now easily solved with the typos tool.
or use shortened words and abbreviations
